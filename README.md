Abstract
The study presented in this thesis provides a broad overview of classical Software Architectural Design supporting tools, with a focus on the DSS MoSAIC.
Quantum systems were introduced and a survey of quantum software design support tools implemented in recent years was conducted in order to better understand the importance and usefulness of DSS tools for these architectures.
The ontology underlying the MoSAIC system, which supports non-expert users in designing software intended for classical systems, was integrated by modeling key information inherent in design patterns and non-functional requirements for software Architectural Design description for quantum systems. 
By simulating a DSS, using DLQuery and SPARQL Query, the support given to the user by the ontology designed in Protégé was verified. 
The implementation of the QCSupport tool to support non-expert users in Software Architectural Design in the Quantum environment concludes the thesis work. The webapp allows the nonexpert user to view recommended patterns for quantum software design that satisfy the nonfunctional input requirements.
